# Files:
1. encryption.py
    Basically, it performs several actions based on the commands provided, and arguments as well (if needed)
    For instance, the user could type in "PASS" to initiate setting up a new, valid passkey. This file is the most important out of all
2. logger.py
    As the name applies, it appends new messages to a provided txt file (based on the command-line argument). Within the messages, they contain the current
    date, time, command, and result of the command.
3. driver.py
    This file pretty much connects the two files above together via creating new processes. It contains a user interface, making it more accessible to end-users. 
    It also takes in a command line argument, which will be used to log messages to that particular file. 


# Instructions on running the program:
    It's pretty simple, all you need to do is enter the following text in the terminal:
        python driver.py <filename>

    It will require at least one command-line argument to get started. I'll provide my own "file.txt", so feel free to edit it via this program. 
    Everything else will pretty much be explained as you go through the UI. Have fun!
