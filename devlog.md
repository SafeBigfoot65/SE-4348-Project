THIS IS MY FIRST SESSION! I plan on using Python as my chosen programming langauge, because that is the only language I have used frequently in the past few months, other than SQLite. I will work on the Encryption Program first, before worrying about the other two programs. It doesn't seem too bad, after all this is my first time dealing with encryption. But, I hope I'll do my best! Hopefully, I get this encryption program completed by the end of today. If not, by tomorrow.

The encryption program is pretty much done. I may add some minor tweaks later on, but as for now, it's good. The only difficult thing was implementing the logic for the encryption and decryption. I had to watch 
a couple of Youtube videos to get the gist of it. The next program I will work on is the "logger". I felt using a class in the program fits the theme of encryption if we want the passkey to be hidden! Plus, I honestly felt more organized using a class. I'll work on it later this week, if I have time of course.
